# DHBW-SE-Presentation-Godot
 This is a presentation for SE at DHBW about the GODOT Engine.
 It contains a very small example project.

## Downloads
 You can download the current version at: [GODOT homepage](https://godotengine.org/download) <br>
 If you want to search for a specific version you can find it either on [GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases) or on [tuxfamily](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/) <br>
 And the gamers can find the standard version on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404790/Godot_Engine/)

## What should I use ? Standard or Mono?
 Depends on whether you want to use C# for scripting. If you use C# you have to use the Mono version otherwise you don't need it so use the Standard version.

## How to start:
 0. download GODOT
 1. start GODOT 
 2. create a new Project
 3. <b>have fun</B> <i>this is the most important part</i>

 You can find my demo project in this repo and use it as a reference or if this together with the presentation isn't enough [this](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/) might help as it is the official documentation to GODOT.
